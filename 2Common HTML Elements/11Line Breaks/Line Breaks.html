You saw how modifying the spacing between code in an HTML file doesn't affect the positioning of elements in the browser. If you are interested in modifying the spacing in the browser, you can use HTML's line break element: <br />.

The line break element is one self-closing tag. You can use it anywhere within your HTML code and a line break will be shown in the browser.

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br />Thou art more lovely and more temperate
The code in the example above will result in an output that looks like the following:

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Note: Line breaks are not the standard way of manipulating the positioning of HTML elements, but it's likely that you'll come across them every now and then. In later units, you'll learn more advanced techniques for positioning HTML elements.
