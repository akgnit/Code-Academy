It's important to understand that the formatting of the code in index.html will not affect the positioning of the elements within the browser.

For example, if you wanted to increase the space between a paragraph and an image on your web page, you would not be able to accomplish this by simply adding more spacing between the paragraph element and image element within index.html. This is because the browser ignores whitespace present in HTML files like index.html.

On the other hand, using whitespace in HTML files is important so that your code is easy to read and follow.

For example, the following code is difficult to read and understand:

<html><head></head>
<body><h1>Hello!</h1><p>This is a paragraph!</body>
</html>
The following code, however, uses spacing effectively to make it easier to read:

<html>
<head>
  <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph!</p>
</body>
</html>

Instructions
In index.html, place your cursor directly after the closing tag of ordered list. Next, press the "Enter" (or "Return") key on your keyboard a few times and then run your code. Note that there is no change in the positioning of the elements in the browser.

White space is meant to increase code readability, not to affect element positioning.
