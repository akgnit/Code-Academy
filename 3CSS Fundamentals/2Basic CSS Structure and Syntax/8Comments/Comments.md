Just like HTML, you can also leave comments in your CSS file. CSS comments begin with /* and end with */, like so:

/* This is a comment in CSS! */
Including comments in your code is helpful for many reasons:

They help you (and others) understand your code if you decide to come back and review it at a much later date.
They allow you to experiment with new code, without having to delete old code.
/* Paragraph Styling */
p {
  color: Blue;
}
In the example above, a comment is used to specify CSS styling for paragraphs.

/*
h1 {
  color: Red;
}
*/
In the example above, a valid CSS rule has been "commented out." This practice is useful when you want to experiment with new code without having to delete old code.
