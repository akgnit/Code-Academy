Styling with CSS would be very inefficient if you were forced to manually style the same property across many elements.

For example, what if you wanted to change the color of 10 different elements to Aquamarine in CSS?.

Fortunately, you can select multiple elements at once so that you can save time styling a shared property.

h1, h2, p {
  color: Green;
}

In the example above, the <h1> heading, the <h2> heading, and the paragraph have all been styled to appear Green
using a multiple element selector.
A multiple element selector can save you time when you want to style the same property across many elements.

Use one selector to change the color of the heading and paragraph to DarkSlateGray.
