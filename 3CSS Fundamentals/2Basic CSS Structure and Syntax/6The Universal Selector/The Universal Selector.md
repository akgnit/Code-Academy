There's a special selector that can instantly select every single element on the web page: the universal selector.

* {
  font-family: Arial;
}
In the example above, the universal selector, *, is used to select every element on the page and set the font to Arial.

What makes the universal selector so special? When all elements on a web page require the same styling,
it's often more efficient to set that styling using the universal selector. 
Afterwards, you can modify (or remove) that styling for specific elements that don't require it.

In a later lesson, you'll use the universal selector to help you understand how HTML elements are laid out within the
browser and how to position those elements.

Instructions

1.
In style.css, add the universal selector. Inside of the selector's body, set the font-family to Georgia.
