Although CSS is a different language than HTML, it's possible to write CSS code directly within an HTML file. This is possible because of the <style> element.

The <style> element allows you to write CSS code between its opening and closing tags. To use the <style> element, it must be placed inside of the head.

<head>
  <style>

  </style>
</head>
Once <style> is placed in the web page's head, we can begin writing CSS code.

<head>
  <style>
    h2 {
    font-family: Arial;
    }
  </style>
</head>
