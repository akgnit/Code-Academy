What kind of information about the web page can the <head> element contain?

Well, if you look at the top of your browser (or at one of the tabs you may have open in this browser window), you'll notice the words Learn HTML & CSS: Part I | Codecademy, which is the title of this web page.

The browser displays the title of the page because the title can be specified directly inside of the <head> element, by using a <title> element.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Coding Journal</title>
  </head>
</html>

If we were to open a file containing the HTML code in the example above, the browser would display the words My Coding Journal in the title bar (or in the tab's title).
