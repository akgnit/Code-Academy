What if you don't want the border thickness to be the same on all four sides?

In that case, another version of the border-width property allows you to specify the width for each side of the border.

p {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 3px 1px 2px 1px;
}
The values in the example above refer to the border width in clockwise order (top: 3 pixels, right: 1 pixel, bottom: 2 pixels, left: 1 pixel).

Instructions

1.
In style.css, use one declaration to set the top and bottom borders of the .hotel class selector to a width of 4 pixels. Set the left and right borders to a width of 2 pixels.
