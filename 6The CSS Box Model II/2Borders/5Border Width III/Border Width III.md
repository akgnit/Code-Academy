If you'd like to be even more specific about the width of different sides of the border, you can use the following properties:

border-top-width
border-right-width
border-bottom-width
border-left-width
Each property affects the width of only one side of the border, giving you more flexibility in customization.

p {
  border-style: solid;
  border-left-width: 4px;
}
In the example above, only the left side of the border will be set to a width of 4 pixels.

Instructions

1.
First, delete the border width you declared in the previous exercise:

border-width: 4px 2px 4px 2px;
Then, in style.css, set only the top border width of the .hotel class selector to 5 pixels.
