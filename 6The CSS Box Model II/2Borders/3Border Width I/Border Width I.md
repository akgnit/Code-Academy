You can control the thickness, or width, of borders with the border-width property. The value of border-width is given in pixels.

p {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 5px;
}
In the example above, the solid borders of all paragraphs on the page would be set to a thickness of 5 pixels.

It's also possible to also set the border-width property to one of the following named thicknesses:

thin
medium
thick
While these values are perfectly valid, you may not see them often, but it's good to know that they exist.

Instructions:

1.
In style.css, set the border width of the .hotel selector to 2 pixels.
