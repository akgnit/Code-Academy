If you want to be even more specific about the amount of padding on each side of a box's content, you can use the following properties:

padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left
Each property affects the padding on only one side of the box's content, giving you more flexibility in customization.

p {
  border: 3px solid #2D3FA3;
  padding-bottom: 10px;
}
In the example above, only the bottom side of the paragraph's content will have a padding of 10 pixels.

Instructions
