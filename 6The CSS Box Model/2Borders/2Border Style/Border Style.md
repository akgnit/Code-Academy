It's not possible to view a box's border if the border's style has not been set. A border's style can be set with the border-style property. This property can take on one of the following values:

solid - border is a solid line.
dashed - border is a series of lines or dashes.
dotted - border is a series of square dots.
double - border is two solid black lines.
groove - border is a groove (or carving).
inset - border appears to cut into the screen.
outset - border appears to pop out of the screen.
ridge - border appears as a picture frame.
hidden or none - no border.
div {
  border-style: solid;
}
In the example above, a solid black line will appear around all divs on the page.
