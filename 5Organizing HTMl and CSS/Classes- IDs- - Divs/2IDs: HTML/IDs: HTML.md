With the proper labels, we can style individual HTML elements! Specifically, we can label HTML elements with a unique identifier, or ID. We can then style that specific element in the stylesheet.

To label an element with an ID, we can use the id attribute on an HTML element.

<h1 id="botswana">Botswana</h1>
In the example above, the heading is labeled with an id of botswana.

What purpose do IDs serve? IDs are intended to label unique elements in an HTML file. No two HTML elements should ever share the same ID â€” that would defeat the purpose of a unique identifier!

Instructions

In index.html, add an ID to the <div> nested inside of the first <div> element. The ID should be set to header-text.

Note: Don't focus on understanding the <div> element just yet, we'll cover it later in this lesson.
