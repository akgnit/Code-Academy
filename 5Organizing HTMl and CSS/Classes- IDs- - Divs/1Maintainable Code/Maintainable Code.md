In this unit, you'll learn about a critical skill beneficial for all web developers: organizing HTML code. Being able to clearly organize HTML code helps in the following ways:

Writing clear, maintainable HTML code for yourself and for other developers.
Venturing into more advanced CSS styling.

By organizing HTML code with labels for elements, you'll learn how to style specific HTML elements at-will.
