The current revision of CSS, CSS3 (at the time of this writing), introduces a new way to specify colors using HSL colors.

HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. Specifically, this is what each means:

Hue - the technical term that describes what we understand as "color." In HSL, hue is represented on a color wheel. It can take on values between 0 and 360.
Saturation - the amount of gray in a given color. In HSL, saturation is specified using a percentage between 0% and 100%. The percentage 0% represents a shade of gray, whereas 100% represents full saturation.
Lightness - the amount of white in a given color. Similar to saturation, lightness is specified using a percentage between 0% and 100%. The percentage 0% represents black, whereas 100% represents white. 50% is normal.
You can use HSL colors in your CSS like this:

h1 {
  color: hsl(182, 20%, 50%);
}
Notice that using HSL is very similar to using RGB.

Note: Because HSL is a part of CSS3, older browsers may not support it. In a later exercise, you'll learn how to work around support issues for colors.
