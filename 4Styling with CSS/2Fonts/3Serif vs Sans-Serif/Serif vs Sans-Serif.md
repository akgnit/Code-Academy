The practice of typography has been around for centuries! Over time, typographers have refined their craft and have developed many different typefaces, which has allowed them, in some cases, to classify them as one of the following two types: serif fonts and sans-serif fonts.

Serif - the letters in these fonts have extra details on the ends of each letter. Examples include fonts like Times New Roman or Georgia, among others.
Sans-Serif - the letters in these fonts do not have extra details on the ends of each letter. Instead, letters have straight, flat edges. Some examples include Arial or Helvetica.
The majority of fonts that we'll study in this lesson will be either serif or sans-serif fonts.
