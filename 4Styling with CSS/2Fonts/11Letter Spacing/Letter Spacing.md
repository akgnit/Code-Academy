You've learned how to increase the spacing between lines of text and words, but it's possible to get even more detailed: increasing the spacing between individual letters.

The technical term for the spacing between letters is the "kerning". The kerning can be adjusted with the letter-spacing property in CSS.

h1 {
  letter-spacing: 0.3em;
}
Like word spacing, it's not common to increase the kerning in text, but sometimes it enhances the readability of uppercase text.

Instructions

1.
