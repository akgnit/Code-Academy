Text on a web page must also be easy to read. When text is styled to appear larger, the vertical spacing between lines of text can decrease, creating text that is difficult to read, particularly in paragraphs.

To avoid this problem, you can modify the spacing between lines of text with the line-height property.

p {
  line-height: 1.5em;
}

When the line height of an element is modified, you are manipulating the leading (pronounced "ledding") of the font. When the line height is increased, the spacing between lines of text increases, which can make text easier to read.

The line height can be modified using pixels or ems, but the unit of ems is preferred, since ems offer a spacing relative to the size of the text on the page.

Instructions

1. In style.css, set the line height of the paragraph element to 1.7em.
