You can also italicize words with the font-style property.

h3 {
  font-style: italic;
}
The italic value causes text to appear in italics. The font-style property also has a normal value, for the same reasons discussed in the previous exercise.

Instructions

1.
In style.css, set the font style of the subheading to italic.
