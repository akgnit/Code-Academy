Take a look at the block-level elements in the browser to the right.

Notice that block-level elements not only take up their own line of space (and therefore sit on top of each other), but they also consistently appear in the same position on the web page.

Specifically, they appear on the left side of the browser, which is their default position.

The default position of an element can be changed by setting its position property. The position property can take one of four values:

static - the default value (it does not need to be specified)
relative
absolute
fixed
In the next few exercise, you'll learn about the values in items 2, 3, and 4 above. For now, it's important to understand that if you favor the default position of an HTML, you don't need to set its position property.

Instructions

1.
In style.css, set the position in .question to static.

Notice that setting position to static does nothing. That's because static simply refers to the default behavior.
